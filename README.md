# Chess

Chess programming library.

This library is still in an early stage of development; many important features
are missing.

## Examples

See the examples folder.

`PgnViewer.elm`: A primitive PGN viewer, displaying a chess board with back
and forward arrows along with a text area for pasting a game in PGN notation.
If the text area contents are not a valid PGN game, the board is replaced with
an error message.

`ChessBoard.elm`: Displays an interactive chess board supporting click-click
move input, with buttons for rotating the board and navigating through the
game.
